My research interest in mostly about computer vision and deep learning. 
In the past, I have been doing some research in image segmentation and optical flow estimation using deep learning. 
Currently, I am doing my research in the classification of dynamic textures (human crowds, herds of animals, etc.) which is closely related to my PhD subject. 
Here are some details of my recent researches.

## PhD research
The thesis research work is about video analysis. 
More specifically, we are interested in identification and characterization of trajectories in videos. 
Contrary to common trajectories corresponding to the movement of identifiable objects in videos (tracking of a person, a vehicle, etc.), the goal of this work 
will be rather on the analysis of the movement of a set of objects forming an heterogeneous "mass", like some fluids, human crowds, 
or animal swarms, for example. 
Therefore, with respect to the above context, this thesis will focus on three highly interdependent aspects:
- Discovery and extraction of several spatio-temporal patterns that are specific from studied video sequences.
- Joint analysis of these patterns along the time (multi-trajectory/sequence analysis).
- Use of machine learning procedures (in particularly deep learning) to facilitate the discovery and analysis of such patterns and sequences.

The extraction of spatio-temporels patterns should allow to characterize locally the movements observable in the video. 
In order to do this, we should be able to build some spatio-temporal descriptors based on dictionaries for example. 
One way to extract these patterns could be to use deep learning techniques. 
Once obtained, these patterns can be mixed together to build sequences.

The next step is to analyze these sequences to find more complex behaviours such as reoccurrence of subsequences, abnormal subsequences, etc. 
For this, we will focus on the use of data mining methods (sequence mining), as well as sequence matching techniques and pattern recognition techniques, that will have to be adapted to the specificities of the videos. 
In particular, the goal will not be to work on a unique sequence but jointly with several ones that will characterize the behaviour of the heterogenous “mass” observed in the video.
